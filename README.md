## Projects

### [**LLM Hallucination Prevention System**](https://github.com/Chitragupta16/LLM_hallucination_prevention) | Nov 2025
*Python, Streamlit, FastAPI, NLP*

- Engineered ML-powered fact verification pipeline extracting 7 entity types from LLM responses using spaCy NER, cross-referencing against Wikipedia API with 90%+ accuracy for high-confidence claims
- Designed contradiction detection algorithm tracking factual consistency across conversation history, implementing similarity scoring and numeric variance analysis to flag conflicting statements
- Deployed production-ready web application on Streamlit Cloud with RESTful API backend, featuring side-by-side response comparison, color-coded verification indicators, and automated citation generation

### [**Player Re-Identification in Soccer Matches**](https://github.com/Chitragupta16/player-reid-yolo) | Jun 2024
*Python, YOLOv11, OpenCV, Deep SORT, PyTorch*

- Developed player detection and tracking pipeline using YOLOv11 for bounding box detection and Deep SORT for consistent ID assignment
- Implemented re-identification logic to maintain player identities across occlusions and overlapping frames in real-time video feeds
- Simulated match scenarios ensuring accurate tracking for analytics, with robust handling of ball-player interactions

### [**Urban Green Space Mapping using VM-UNet**](https://github.com/Chitragupta16/Satellite_Segmentation_VMUN) | Dec 2024 - Mar 2025
